# REDUX FEEDBACK LOOP PROJECT

## Description

Prime Digital Academy week 11 Weekend Challenge

This project took me about 6 hours for it's current state. In this project we had to create multiple feedback pages where have information to be stored then sent to the database. We had to create server side as well as client side. To do this we had to use Axios to GET and POST information to our database. Hashrouters were required to move along pages, as well as back. Knowledge of using props as well as dispatch to access our store was crucial to having data sent successfully. The end product will allow you to go along multiple pages, store data, display all data on a review page, then submit it all to the database all while looping back to the first page to send data again as needed.
